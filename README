Overview:

The goal of the lyrics flagger is to traverse a database of songs and
determine if any of the songs contain specific lyrics. Songs that contain
these lyrics are flagged to indicate this fact in the database.

Currently the program is designed to interface with the Rivendell
Radio Automation System (www.rivendellaudio.org), Version 2. It is primarly
used to search lyrics for speicifc profnae words and then flag these songs
as profane in the Rivendell library, thsu isnuring that they are not
inserted into the automaticlly generated automation logs.

Version 2 constitutes a significant rewrite of the version 1 code to
minimize dependencies, and avoid the use of the now defunct LyricsFly API.
